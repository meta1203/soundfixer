# SoundFixer

![Screenshot](https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/291/291937.png?modified=1701909437)

a WebExtension that lets you fix annoying sound problems on the web (e.g. in YouTube videos): sound in one channel only, too quiet even at maximum volume, too loud even at minimum volume.

[Download on addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/soundfixer/)!

(NOTE: this SoundFixer only exists for Firefox! Anything uploaded to other browsers' extension stores is not mine! Please don't report bugs to me if you use those.)

No more "[Plug your headphones only halfway into the jack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11912213)" :D

(Unfortunately, doesn't work on all websites â€” specifically, we're not allowed to use the Web Audio API from a cross-domain `<audio>` source. Thankfully, YouTube is not cross-domain!)
